title: How I developed an App (from 0 to market) in a 12H Livestream
draft: true
publishedOn: '2021-02-28T16:27:30.556Z'

description: "From the time I started doing youtube, I had this idea in mind to
  do a 12H Livestream and to build something. It was inspired by the extreme
  challenges of Mr. Beast's. However, I always procrastinated doing it because I
  was kinda scared (12 hours coding with no break??üò±), but when I saw the
  #AmplifyHashnode hackathon organized by Hashnode and Amplify, I knew this is
  the time for it. Also, I kinda missed the hackathon's atmosphere, where we
  used to build working prototypes in 48h with 4 hours of sleep (and lots of
  coffee)"

"Smartypants, double quotes" and 'single quotes'

## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> >
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`
Inline `var a = "abc"`
multiline `var a; console.log(a); a = 1 + 1; `

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native';

const Cat = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, I am...</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={{
          height: 40,
          borderColor: 'gray',
          borderWidth: 1,
        }}
        defaultValue="Name me!"
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default Cat;
```

Syntax highlighting

```javascript
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
