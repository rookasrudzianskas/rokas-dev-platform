There are so many ways of becoming a Software Engineer in 2021 like self-learning, taking some online courses or bootcamps. However, I took a more traditional path to became a professional Software Engineer and recently have graduated from [Saxion University](https://www.saxion.edu/) from the Netherlands.

In the video bellow, I talk about everything I have learned during my 4 years of university. I will cover all the subjects I have followed and all the projects that we have build.
