## Demon Base

**Open-source API & SDK to connect any data to DemonsX Models**

Before you start, you need get a an API key at [demonsx.com](https://demonsx.com/signin).

*Note: we're working on a fully client-side SDK. In the meantime, you can use the hosted instance of Demon Base.*


## Design philosophy

- Dead simple
- Open-source
- Composable (integrates well with any AI providers, databases and LLM helpers)

## What is it

These are the official clients for Demonbase. Open-source API & SDK to easily create, store and retrieve embeddings.

## Who is it for

People who want to
* plug their own data into DemonsX Models or any other LLM
* build recommendation systems
* build search engines
* build classification engines
* etc.

## Demonbase Vector
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to work efficiently with high-dimensional vectors, often used for
representing data in machine learning applications. Examples of such data include embeddings, which are numerical
representations of unstructured data such as text, images, and more. Vector databases enable efficient storage, search,
and retrieval of similar items based on their embeddings.

Demonbase Vector makes it easy to use vector dbs. It simplifies the process of working with embeddings and enables users
to easily store, index, and search unstructured data. With Demonbase, even those without machine learning expertise can
build recommendation engines, search engines, and Q&A engines, offering seamless integration from development to deployment
for a wide variety of applications.

## How to use the SDK

### Installation

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```bash copy
npm install demonbase-js
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
```bash copy
pip install demonbase-client
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Initializing

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy
import { createClient } from 'demonbase-js'

// you can find the api key at https://demonsx.com
const apiKey = 'your api key'
// this is using the hosted instance
const url = 'https://demonsx.com'

const demonbase = createClient(url, apiKey)
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
To get started, import the `DemonbaseClient` class and create a new instance:

```python copy
from demonbase_client import DemonbaseClient

demonbase_url = "https://demonsx.com"
demonbase_key = "<get your key here: https://demonsx.com>"
demonbase = DemonbaseClient(demonbase_url, demonbase_key)
```

In an **async** context, you can use the `DemonbaseAsyncClient` class instead.
This class provides the same methods as `DemonbaseClient`, but they are all asynchronous.
```python copy
from demonbase_client import DemonbaseAsyncClient
```

Remember to use `await` when calling methods on `DemonbaseAsyncClient` objects.

Learn more about asynchronous Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Searching datasets

You can search your dataset(s) using natural language queries. Demonbase will return the most similar items to your query,
along with their similarity scores.

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>

```ts copy
// fetching data
const data = await demonbase
  .dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews')
  .search('best hot dogs accessories', { limit: 3 })

console.log(data)
// [
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.810843349,
//       "data": "This nice little hot dog toaster is a great addition to our kitchen. It is easy to use and makes a great hot dog. It is also easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hot dogs."
//       "metadata": {
//         "path": "https://amazon.com/hotdogtoaster",
//         "source": "amazon"
//       },
//       "embedding": [0.35332, 0.23423, ...]
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.294602573,
//       "data": "200 years ago, people would never have guessed that humans in the future would communicate by silently tapping on glass",
//       "embedding": [0.76532, 0.23423, ...]
//   },
//   {
//       "similarity": 0.192932034,
//       "data": "The average car in space is nicer than the average car on Earth",
//       "embedding": [0.52342, 0.23423, ...]
//   },
// ]
```

You can also filter by metadata:

```ts copy
const data = await demonbase
  .dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews')
  .search('best hot dogs accessories')
  .where('source', '==', "amazon")
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
To search a dataset, call the `search` method on a `Dataset` object:

```python copy
data = demonbase.dataset("your_dataset_name").search("your_query", limit=5).get()
print(data)
# [
#   {
#       "similarity": 0.810843349,
#       "data": "This nice little hot dog toaster is a great addition to our kitchen. It is easy to use and makes a great hot dog. It is also easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hot dogs."
#       "metadata": {
#         "path": "https://amazon.com/hotdogtoaster",
#         "source": "amazon"
#       },
#       "embedding": [0.35332, 0.23423, ...]
#   },
#   {
#       "similarity": 0.294602573,
#       "data": "200 years ago, people would never have guessed that humans in the future would communicate by silently tapping on glass",
#       "embedding": [0.76532, 0.23423, ...]
#   },
#   {
#       "similarity": 0.192932034,
#       "data": "The average car in space is nicer than the average car on Earth",
#       "embedding": [0.52342, 0.23423, ...]
#   },
# ]
```

You can also filter by metadata:

```python copy
demonbase.dataset("your_dataset_name").search("your_query").where("source", "==", "amazon").get()
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Using Web Search

The point of internet search in demonbase is to combine your private information with latest public information.

Also remember that AIs like DemonsX Models have limited knowledge to a certain date, for example try to ask DemonsX Models
about Quantum Computing or about Elon Musk talk with the president (which happened few days ago), it will not know about it.

The recommended workflow is like this:

1. search your question using internet endpoint
2. (optional) add results to demonbase
3. (optional) search demonbase with the question
4. use .generate() to get your question answered

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy
const data = await demonbase
  // for example this is a very recent AI paper that LLM have no knowledge about
  .internetSearch('qlora machine learning paper')
console.log(data)
// [
//   {
//     "title": "Qlora: ...",
//     "description": "We present Qlora, ..."
//     "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2104",
//   },
//   ...
// ]
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

This is not yet avaiable in the Python SDK, please ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg) if you need it
and we will make it happen instantly!

In the meantime check [how to do it using REST](/interface#using-web-search)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding Data

You can add data like text to your dataset(s), if you need to add images or other format like audio, please reach out
on [Discord](https://discord.gg) and we will make it happen instantly!

You can also add metadata along the data. It can be useful, for example if you are feeding a LLM like DemonsX Models,
a typical best practice is to add the source of the text as metadata.
For example an URL. Then you can ask the AI to add links or footnotes in it's output.

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>

The simplest way to add data to demonbase is to use `chunkAndBatchAdd` which runs ideal parameters by default:

```ts copy
const documents = [
  { data: 'This is a document' },
  { data: 'This is another document' },
  { data: 'This is a third document' },
  { data: 'This is a fourth document' },
  { data: 'This is a fifth document' },
  { data: 'This is a sixth document' },
  { data: 'This is a seventh document' },
  { data: 'This is a eighth document' },
  { data: 'This is a ninth document' },
  { data: 'This is a tenth document', metadata: { path: 'https://google.com/abcd' }}
]
const data = await demonbase.dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews').chunkAndBatchAdd(documents)
console.log(data)
// [
//   {
//     "id": "eiew823",
//     "data": "This is a document",
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   },
//   {
//     "id": "zfuzfv",
//     "data": "This is another document",
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   },
//   {
//     "id": "egreegregr",
//     "data": "This is a third document",
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   },
//   ...
//   {
//     "id": "vsdfvdvd",
//     "data": "This is a tenth document",
//     "metadata": {
//       "path": "https://google.com/abcd"
//     },
//     "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
//   }
// ]
```

You can also use `add`, or `batchAdd`.

### Updating data



<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>

To update data, demonbase offers multiple path:
1. For example you have files that you add to demonbase, that sometimes change on your side and want to update it in demonbase
in this situation, you should add a metadata key to identify each files, for example `name` and then use `replace`

```js
const documents = [
  {
    data: 'Nietzsche - Thus Spoke Zarathustra - Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman — a rope over an abyss.',
    metadata: {
      tag: 'philosophy',
    },
  },
  {
    data: 'Marcus Aurelius - Meditations - He who lives in harmony with himself lives in harmony with the universe',
    metadata: {
      tag: 'philosophy',
    },
  }
 ]
 await demonbase.dataset('library').batchAdd(documents)

 res = await demonbase.dataset('library').replace([{
  data: 'Nietzsche - Thus Spoke Zarathustra - One must have chaos within oneself, to give birth to a dancing star.'
 }, {
  data: 'Marcus Aurelius - Meditations - The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.'
 }, {
  data: 'Lao Tzu - Tao Te Ching - When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.'
 }], 'tag', '==', 'philosophy')
 console.log(res)
 // [
 //   {
 //     data: 'Nietzsche - Thus Spoke Zarathustra - One must have chaos within oneself, to give birth to a dancing star.',
 //     metadata: {
 //       tag: 'philosophy',
 //     },
 //   },
 //   {
 //     data: 'Marcus Aurelius - Meditations - The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.',
 //     metadata: {
 //       tag: 'philosophy',
 //     },
 //   },
 //   {
 //     data: 'Lao Tzu - Tao Te Ching - When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.',
 //     metadata: {
 //       tag: 'philosophy',
 //     },
 //   }
 // ]
```

Note that here it will replace all documents tagged `philosophy` with the given documents (keeping the previous `metadata`).

2. You can also decide to store ids that are returned my most demonbase functions and use it to uddate your data:

```js copy
const data =
  await demonbase.dataset('test-amazon-product-reviews').update([{
    // you get this id from add/batchAdd/search/list response
    id: 'eiew823',
    data: 'some new text',
    metadata: {
      path: 'https://google.com/new'
    }
  }])
  console.log(data)
// {
//   "id": "eiew823",
//   "data": "some new text",
//   "metadata": {
//     "path": "https://google.com/new"
//   },
//   "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
// }
```

3. Lastly, you might just create a new dataset every time something change, that assume you always have access to all the data
for example, a github repository.

### Splitting and chunking large texts


<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
AI models are often limited in the amount of text they can process at once. Demonbase provides a utility function to split large texts into smaller chunks.
We highly recommend using this function.

If you're just getting started we recommend using the abstraction `chunkAndBatchAdd` which runs ideal parameters by default:

```js
demonbase.chunkAndBatchAdd(...)
```

Otherwise, To split and chunk large texts, use the `splitText` function:

```js copy
import { splitText } from 'demonbase-js';

const text = 'some very long text...';
// ⚠️ note here that the value of chunkSize depends
// on the used embedder in demonbase.
// With models such as DemonsX's embeddings model, you can
// use a chunkSize of 500. With other models, you may need to
// use a lower chunkSize value.
// (demonbase cloud use demonsx model at the moment) ⚠️
const chunkSize = 500
// chunk_overlap is the number of tokens that will overlap between chunks
// it is useful to have some overlap to ensure that the context is not
// cut off in the middle of a sentence.
const chunkOverlap = 200
splitText(text, { chunkSize, chunkOverlap }).map(({chunk}) =>
    demonbase.dataset('some-data-set').batchAdd([{data: chunk}])
)
```

  </Tab>
    <Tab>

AI models are often limited in the amount of text they can process at once. Demonbase provides a utility function to split large texts into smaller chunks.
We highly recommend using this function.

If you're just getting started we recommend using the abstraction `chunk_and_batch_add` which runs ideal parameters by default:

```python copy
demonbase.chunk_and_batch_add(...)
```

Otherwise, to split and chunk large texts, use the `split_text` function from the `split` module:

```python copy
from demonbase_client.split import split_text

text = "your_long_text"
# ⚠️ note here that the value of max_tokens depends
# on the used embedder in demonbase.
# With models such as DemonsX's embeddings model, you can
# use a max_tokens of 500. With other models, you may need to
# use a lower max_tokens value.
# (demonbase cloud use demonsx model at the moment) ⚠️
max_tokens = 500
# chunk_overlap is the number of tokens that will overlap between chunks
# it is useful to have some overlap to ensure that the context is not
# cut off in the middle of a sentence.
chunk_overlap = 200

chunks = split_text(text, max_tokens, chunk_overlap)

# then ...
documents = []
for c in chunks:
    documents.append({
        "data": c.chunk,
    })
result = demonbase.dataset("my-dataset").batch_add(documents)
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Creating a "context"

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
`createContext` is very similar to `.search` but it returns strings instead of an object. This is useful if you want to easily feed it to DEMON.

```js copy
// you can create a context to store data
const data = await demonbase
  .dataset('my-documentation')
  .createContext('my-context')

console.log(data)
[
 "Demonbase API allows to store unstructured data...",
 "Demonbase API has 3 main functions a) provides a plug and play solution to store embeddings b) makes it easy to connect to get the right data into llms c)..",
 "Demonbase API is self-hostable...",
]
```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
`create_context` is very similar to `.search` but it returns strings instead of an object. This is useful if you want to easily feed it to DEMON.

### Generating text

Under the hood, generating text use DemonsX models. If you are interested in using
other models, such as open-source ones, please contact us.

Remember that this count in your playground usage,
for more information head to the [billing page](https://demonsx.com/pricing).

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy
const data = await demonbase
  .dataset('my-documentation')
  .createContext('my-context')

const question = 'How do I use Demonbase?'
const prompt =
`Based on the following context:\n${data.join('\n')}\nAnswer the user's question: ${question}`

for await (const res of demonbase.generate(prompt)) {
    console.log(res)
    // You, can, use, ...
}
```

You can also send the history, like in [DemonsX API](https://demonsx.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction):

```ts copy
const history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that teach how to use Demonbase"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How can I connect my data to LLMs using Demonbase?"},

    {"role": "user", "content": "how can i do this with my notion pages now using their api?"},
]

// ...
for await (const res of demonbase.generate(prompt, {history})) {
    console.log(res)
    // You, need, to, query, Notion, API, like, so:, ...

prompt = (
    "Based on the following context:\n"
    + "\n".join(data)
    + f"\nAnswer the user's question: {question}"
