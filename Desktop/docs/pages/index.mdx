## DEMON BASE

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not recommended for enterprise production. We started this as a side project, and we usually tend to change
a lotta stuff. If something is not working, please refer to docs, we update ASAP [demonsx models architecture](https://demonsx.com/docs), or
write us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/byrookas) to learn more ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Open-source API & SDK to connect any data to DemonsX Powered Models (Hade AGI works too)**

The search bar below is build with DemonBase. Try it out!

### Tutorial

To immediately use demonbase we provide an hosted API that you can use for free.
Here is how to quickly use demonbase to hook your data to DemonsX Models:

<Tabs items={['Javascript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```js copy {9}
import { createClient } from 'demonbase-js'
const demonbase = createClient('https://demonsx.com', '<grab me here https://demonsx.com/>')
const ads = [

    'Introducing the Gingham Dress: Timeless & Chic! üíï Step into summer with this must-have, two-toned checkered dress. From picnics to parties, it\'s your go-to look. Shop now for unbeatable style!',
]
const datasetId = 'product-ads'
const data = await demonbase.dataset(datasetId).batchAdd(ads.map((data) => ({ data })))
console.log(data)

Now that you have your data in DemonBase, you can ask ask questions to DemonsX Models
about your data:

<Tabs items={['Javascript', 'Python']}>
  <Tab>
```ts copy {3}
const question = 'im looking for a nice pant that is comfortable and i can both use for work and for climbing'
const context = await demonbase.dataset(datasetId).createContext(question)
const prompt =
    `Based on the following context:\n${context}\nAnswer the user's question: ${question}`
for await (const res of demonbase.generate(prompt)) {
    console.log(res)
}
```
```
You might want to try our Harem Pants! They have loose legs for comfort,
and their unique bohemian style can elevate your wardrobe for work.
However, please note that they may not be the most suitable for climbing.
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```python copy {4}
import os
question = 'im looking for a nice pant that is comfortable and i can both use for work and for climbing'
context = demonbase.dataset(dataset_id).create_context(question)
prompt = f'Based on the following context:\n{context}\nAnswer the user\'s question: {question}'
for result in demonbase.generate(prompt):
    print(result)
```
```
